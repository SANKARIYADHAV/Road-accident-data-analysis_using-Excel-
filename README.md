üìù Project Steps
1. Introduction
    The Road Accident Data Analysis using Excel project aims to leverage the power of Microsoft Excel to process, analyze, and visualize extensive road accident datasets. The primary goal is to create a       
    dashboard that provides actionable insights for stakeholders involved in road safety and accident management. The project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in enhancing road safety, 
    reducing accidents, and improving response mechanisms.
   
3. Project Introduction
   This project involves analyzing a large dataset of road accidents sourced from Kaggle. The data contains over 3 million rows and 21 fields, offering a wealth of information about accident severity,   
   casualties, vehicle types, road conditions, and other critical factors.
   The client's primary requirement is to develop a Road Accident Dashboard that provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends related to road accidents. The project includes data cleaning, 
   processing, analysis, and visualization to ensure that the final output is accurate, insightful, and user-friendly.

4. Client Requirements:
    Primary KPI: Total casualties resulting from accidents.
    Primary KPIs:
        Total casualties and percentage by accident severity.
        Maximum casualties by vehicle type.
    Secondary KPIs:
        Casualties by vehicle type.
        Monthly trends comparing current and previous years.
        Maximum casualties by road type.
        Distribution of casualties by road surface type.
        Relation between casualties and area/location (day vs. night).

5. Stakeholders Identification
Key stakeholders:
    Ministry of Transport
    Road Transport Department
    Police Force
